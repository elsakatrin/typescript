This was my first time using Typescript. I think it was really nice to use with React. 

My project is really simple and small but I thought that would help me to see how typescript comes into something that I already know. 
I used a random API from the internet. 
First I had to declare everything from the api object with interface. There Typescript tells us what each item in the property is. I used this link to convert it from an API object: http://json2ts.com/ 
In the useState I added the interface name in <> so typescript would know what interface I was using. Below that I had to add in all the things from API object where the strings were empty strings so Typescript would understand what to do with them. 
After that the code is just a normal React, where I fetch the API like we've done before. It was nice to do it again an refresh my memory on that. I also added a button that only refreshes the API on click but not the whole page. Then I quicly used CSS to style the page, nothing fancy. 

I commented relevant things into the code :) 





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
